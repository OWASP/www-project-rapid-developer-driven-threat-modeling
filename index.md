pitch: A very brief, one-line description of your project

---

To provide a practical, developer-friendly methodology and supporting materials (documentation, threat templates, examples, and possibly automation tools) that make threat modeling accessible, scalable, and seamlessly integrated into modern software development.

### Road Map
*Phase 1 (0–6 months):*

* Involve additional project members possibly representing organizations with different sizes and regulatory obligations.
* Publish the RaD-TM methodology as an OWASP guide
* Release initial Threat Templates and example models (we aim to have a collection of at least 10 Threat Templates aimed at different roles in the SDLC)
* Set up GitHub repository and community channels

*Phase 2 (6–12 months):*

* Expand Threat Template library (e.g., for additional standards/environments reaching at least 20 Threat Templates)
* Host community sessions or webinars

*Phase 3 (12+ months):*

* Develop basic automation tools or integrations
* Collaborate with other OWASP projects (e.g. Threat Dragon) for support of RaD-TM into threat modeling tools.
